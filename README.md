Brain Tumor Detection using VGG-16 CNN Model

Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying whether a subject has a brain tumor or not based on MRI scans. The model utilizes the VGG-16 architecture and pre-trained weights for training on a binary classification task. Additionally, a web user interface (UI) is provided to facilitate user inputs for tumor detection.
Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy as the metric:

    Validation Set Accuracy: Approximately 88%
    Test Set Accuracy: Approximately 80%

Usage

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    Flask (for the web UI)
Input Images

To use the trained model for testing or prediction, follow these steps to prepare and input images:

    Gather MRI Scan Images: Collect MRI scan images of the brain that you want to analyze for the presence of tumors. Ensure that the images are in a compatible format 
    supported by the model (e.g., JPEG, PNG).

    Preprocess Images (Optional): Depending on the requirements of your model and preprocessing steps applied during training, you may need to preprocess the input images. 
    This could involve resizing, normalization, or other transformations to ensure consistency with the training data.

    Run Model Testing Script: Utilize the provided mainTest.py script to test the trained model on the input images. This script will load the trained model and perform     
    predictions on the input data.

    Interpret Results: After running the testing script, interpret the results to determine the model's predictions for each input image. Results may include probabilities or 
    confidence scores for tumor presence or absence.

    Visualize Results (Optional): Optionally, visualize the results of the model predictions alongside the input images for further analysis and interpretation. This can help 
    in understanding the model's performance and identifying any areas for improvement.

Training the Model

    Run mainTrain.py script to train the CNN model using the VGG-16 architecture and pre-trained weights.
    The trained model will be saved as BrainTumor10Epochs.h5.

Testing the Model

    Run mainTest.py script to test the trained model on test data.
    Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

Web UI

    Ensure you have Flask installed (pip install flask).
    Run the app.py script to start the Flask web server.
    Access the web UI through your browser and provide the required inputs for tumor detection.

Further Improvements

    Fine-tuning Model Parameters: Experiment with different hyperparameters to potentially improve model performance.
    Data Augmentation: Augment the training data to increase diversity and improve model generalization.
    Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble techniques to combine predictions from multiple models for enhanced accuracy.
    Clinical Validation: Conduct rigorous validation studies to evaluate the model's performance on real-world clinical data.
    User Interface Enhancements: Improve the user interface for better usability and accessibility.
